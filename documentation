PROJECT DOCUMENTATION: ADMISSIONS ASSISTANT
====================================================

1. PURPOSE
The goal of this project is to simplify college applications. 
It takes long, confusing university documents and turns them 
into short, actionable "Buckets of Truth."

2. THE THREE BUCKETS
The system organizes information into three sections:
- Hard Gates: GPA, Test scores, and required subjects.
- The Narrative: What to write about in essays and who should 
  write recommendation letters.
- The Logistics: Deadlines and application fees.

3. HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS
- Python: The core language used to run the script.
- ScaleDown AI: A machine learning tool that "prunes" (removes) 
  useless text and keeps only the important facts.
- OS Module: Handles folders and files on your computer.
- Dotenv: Keeps your secret API keys safe.

4. PROJECT SETUP
- "raw_university_data" folder: Put your original text files here.
- "buckets_of_truth" folder: The assistant puts the finished 
  summaries here.
- ".env" file: Stores your ScaleDown API key securely.

5. RUNNING THE SYSTEM
Step 1: Install requirements (pip install scaledown python-dotenv).
Step 2: Add university text to the input folder.
Step 3: Run 'python main.py'.
Step 4: Read the results in the output folder.

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
- If it says "ModuleNotFoundError": Run 'pip install scaledown'.
- If it says "File Not Found": Ensure your folders are named 
  exactly as shown in the project structure.
- If it says "AttributeError": Ensure you are using the 
  'optimize_with_pipeline' method in the code.

7. FUTURE GOALS
- Create a website dashboard to show these results visually.
- Add a feature to compare two universities side-by-side.
